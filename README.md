# Exploring Airbnb Seattle Data

## Dependencies
Pandas and geopandas are required for data analysis. I use seaborn for visualization. It's tricky to install geopandas, please refer to [this link](
https://geopandas.org/en/stable/getting_started/install.html).

## Motivation
I try to answer the following questions from the Airbnb data:
- How is the average price spatially distributed?
- How does the price fluctuate by time?
- Which areas have the highest price change in a year?
- which factors if the accommodation have the best influence of the revisiting

## Files description
Please check discover.ipynb for all data analysis and visualization.

## Acknowledge
I use the data from [Airbnb](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle/data) and [Seattle goverment](https://data.seattle.gov/browse/select_dataset?tags=boundaries).
