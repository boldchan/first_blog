# Exploring Airbnb Seattle Data

## Dependencies
Pandas and geopandas are required for data analysis. I use seaborn for visualization. It's tricky to install geopandas, please refer to [this link](
https://geopandas.org/en/stable/getting_started/install.html).

## Motivation
This is a practice to apply the knowledge I learned from the Udacity Data Scientist Nano Degree to explore the Airbnb Seattle data. The exercise follows the CRISP-DM Process:
- business understanding
- data understanding
- prepare the data
- data modelling
- evaluate the results.

## Files description
Please check discover.ipynb for all data analysis and visualization.

## Acknowledge
I use the data from [Airbnb](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle/data) and [Seattle goverment](https://data.seattle.gov/browse/select_dataset?tags=boundaries).
